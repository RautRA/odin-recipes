    <h2>A simple recipe to make fantastic chicken burgers</h2>
    <p>My friend invented this recipe and it was so fantastic I had to share! The flavor is incredible!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>½ (1 ounce) package guacamole seasoning mix</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
        <li>½ lime, juiced</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>8 slices ciabatta bread</li>
        <li>¼ cup prepared salsa, divided</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the ground chicken, guacamole seasoning, half the cilantro, lime juice, and minced onion until thoroughly combined. Form the chicken mixture into 4 patties. Reserve the other half of the cilantro for garnish.</li>
        <li>Grill the chicken burgers on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink inside, the juices run clear, and the burgers show browned grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>About 2 minutes before burgers are done, place slices of ciabatta bread onto the grill to toast, about 1 minute per side. About 1 minute before the burgers are done, top each burger with a slice of Cheddar cheese, and let melt.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken burgers on the toasted ciabatta bread, topped with about 1 tablespoon of salsa and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
