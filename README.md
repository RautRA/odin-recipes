#Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a simple food recipes website that I created as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum's [Recipes Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) lesson in [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

This website only contains three recipes so far, which you can check out by clicking on following links:

* [Simple Italian Omelet](https://rautra.github.io/odin-recipes/recipes/omelet.html)
* [Mocha Coffee](https://rautra.github.io/odin-recipes/recipes/mocha_coffee.html)
* [Chicken Burgers](https://rautra.github.io/odin-recipes/recipes/chicken_burgers.html)
