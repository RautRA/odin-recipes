    <h2>Mocha coffee is extremely easy to make in this recipe for a simple coffee with chocolate.</h2>
    <p>I call this simple omelet recipe "Italian" for a couple of reasons. First, I used olive oil instead of butter, and second, I cooked the eggs quickly in a hot pan, letting them get a little golden brown. The traditional French omelets are thicker and cooked much more gently.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup hot brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Pour hot coffee into a mug. Stir in cocoa, sugar, and milk.</li>
    </ol>
